This repository contains the R script ("Crossed Arm Walk.R") required to run all analyses reported in the manuscript. The files required to run this script are a file containing all instances of CAW in period 1 ("Instances CAW.csv), grooming and proximity data from period 1 ("Grooming Globals Period 1.csv" and "Proximity Scans Period 1.csv"), and period 2 ("Proximity & Grooming Period 2.csv"). The last file in this repository ("Data for CAW Frequency Graph.csv") contains data required to reproduce the graph of CAW frequence over time in period 1. 

Several manual operations have occurred that are described here and in the R script, most notably the time that individuals were not-visible was calculated manually in Excel using the full dataset and added into the R script. This was done by subtracting the time that individuals were scored as not visible from the full observation time.
